# Asymptotic Analysis

The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.

The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.

## Asymptotic notations

1. [Big O Notation](./Big-O-Notation/) - upper-bound analysis, worst case analysis.
2. [Omega Notation](./Omega-Notation/) - lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm.
3. [Theta Notation](./Theta-Notation/) - average-case complexity of an algorithm
