# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

there is a difference between solving the problem the brute force way and solving the problem right. this is where the DSA comes in.

the common idea of a data structure is to store data in a way that meets the needs of your particular application.

what helps you choose which data structure to go with depends on:

1. how long it takes to first populate the structure.
2. how long it takes to add or find elements.
3. how large the structure is in the memory.
